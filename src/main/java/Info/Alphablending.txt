many ways to alpha blend
source is original image
destination is the final color
alpha is typically blended is 1-sourceAlpha
final color = dest color * source alpha + new color * 1-color source alpha

color final = (green)* 0.6 + (red) * (1-0.6)
so would end up as (0,0.6,0) + (0.4, 0, 0) = 0.4, 0.6, 0
draw everything furthest back first like layers in photoshop
use a-z index, can use to determine which layer stuff is on
sort batches by z indexes and then draw them in that order
