standard approach is retained mode
document mode common for web development
super common for styling
set up call backs to see if button is pressed in js

imGUI
list of elements and rebuilds every frame but not really
can do all kinds of frames and images and can end it
immediate mode
unity is crap but uses IMGUi and so it must be good
