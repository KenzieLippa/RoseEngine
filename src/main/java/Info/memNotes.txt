garbage collected languages cause lag spikes when deleting things
when say new it creates its own heap further down in memory
returns the mem space where its located with a reference 0xfood1234
call accessors on it, go to this mem space and call this method on this object
if big objects with pics and tex and sounds
can be big files and so java will return a reference to them, want to hold onto this
reference is 1 byte

we create a class called asset pool and it will have static hash maps
string hashing to an object which cld be a tex or a shader ect and make sure they dont die
make sure java doesnt garbage collect them
make sure not copying huge amounts of memories when using
using refrence instead of the object itself
