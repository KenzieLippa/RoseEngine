simple geometry in games
can represent game in sprites
4 verticies and using squares
draw batches where things are interconnected
can fit all into one drawing
quads are all two triangles
can stuff all verticies in one array and then upload to gpu
can generate automatically and dont have to worry about them changing
make sure its in th right order
if moving then we upload and then go in and change what we need to and re-upload
creating a render class with add and render
render batch is where the heavy work is
creating vao vbo and ebo
figure out if any change
generates indices
want to batch all of the verticies for all objects and then put them all in one array
then draw all of them at once
must support at least 16 textures, can have that many bound to gpu before sampling
then store them in array and then sample the correct texture
can reserve 0 as a slot to not have a texture to bind
could include the uv0 and uv1 and id for texture all embedded into the tex coords
